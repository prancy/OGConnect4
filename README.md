# Connect 4

This is a classic game for two players where each player first chooses a color and takes turns dropping in colored chips. 
This game includes a seven-column and six-row grid in which a winner is declared by connecting four in any direction.

# Inspiration:
-My Little sister, Nikki and I love the movie Up. I was feeling homesick and she learned how to play this song on the piano (with momma's help). I dedicate my first game/project to my little sis and hope to make this game available to her on her tablet back at home!
